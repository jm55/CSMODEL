    "- About the Dataset<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was provided by Our World in Data (OWID). The file contains different data values that could help paint a better image of a countryâ€™s status for COVID-19. The version used in this project will be the July 15, 2021 release of the dataset, however OWID attempts both daily and weekly update of data whenever possible, thus ensuring that the data they provide is the latest possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collection Process and its Implications<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection was done by the Our World in Data Group which is a research group that focuses on research and aggregation of data in a single accessible repository for the purposes of getting a better picture or even solving world problems that can benefit all of mankind. For the specific dataset, they made use of all possible available data that is publicly released by governments of all nations in the world. According to OWID, the data was collected from the following sources which include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. COVID-19 Data Repository of Johns Hopkins University\n",
    "    2. National Government Reports\n",
    "    3. Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, Blavatnik School of Government\n",
    "    4. United Nations Data (for demographics related data)\n",
    "    5. World Bank Data (for demographics related data)\n",
    "    6. Arroyo Marioli et al. (2020). https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3581633 \n",
    "    \n",
    "The data implies that the data presented assumes to be the latest data possible, with its validity ultimately depending on each government's transparency and accuracy with the data they are reporting publicly and to John Hopkins University.\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "- Structure of Dataset of the File<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    The dataset's structure consists of 102,475 observations with 60 variables available. The structure goes on every country's date when it reported either its first COVID-19 case or first COVID-19 test. The dataset was already distributed publicly on a single file containing all of the relevant information possible. There is however other datasets which contain specific and specialized versions of the current dataset we are using that is also available for use on OWID's Github repository.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "- About the Variables<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The dataset has 60 variables, most of which relate to COVID-19 related numbers such as cases, deaths, recoveries, vaccinations among others, as well as demographic data such as GDP per capita, HDI, median age, population, population density among others."
